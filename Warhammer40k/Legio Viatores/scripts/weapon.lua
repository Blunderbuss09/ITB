	some simple examples of how to start coding weapons.
	to test these weapons, you can - with this mod enabled - write in the console:
	
	weapon Weapon_Template
	weapon Weapon_Template2
	
	you can then look over the code below to see how they were made.
	you'll notice Weapon_Template looks cooler than Weapon_Template2.
	to find out more on why that is, you can look at
	Prime_Punchmech in ITB/scripts/weapons_prime.lua,
	and look at how the GetSkillEffect of this weapon is different.
